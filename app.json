    ],
    [
        "That's true."
    ],
    [
        "But he might just be the type of man who would like to show us he could kill again beneath our noses and still get away with it."
    ],
    [
        "Hmm?"
    ],
    [
        "Bye for now."
    ],

    ],
    [
        "That's what it takes, you know."
    ],
    [
        "Can't let up because we've had four days with nothing new."
    ],
    [
        "I only spoke to Petersen."
    ],
    [
        "It was 9:32 by my watch."
    ],
    [
        "And you found him at 9:35."
    ],
    [
        "That's when you blew your whistle."
    ],
    [
        "What happened?"
    ],

        "Another one?"
    ],

        "Yes."
    ],

    ],

    ],

    ],

        "Nobody."
    ],

    ],

    ],
    [

    ],
    [
        "There wasn't a sound or a movement on this street as I came along it."
    ],
    [
        "Nothing, until..."
    ],
    [
        "But it must have happened right under your nose, man."
    ],

    ],

        "What's the matter with you?"
    ],

        "I don't know."
    ],

    ],

    ],

        "Nobody saw, nobody heard, nothing."
    ],
    [
        "All right."
    ],
    [
        "You and the others spread out."
    ],
    [
        "Search all the buildings on both sides of the street."
    ],
    [
        "Question everybody."
    ],
    [
        "Pull them out of bed if need be."
    ],

        "Any time now."
    ],
    [
        "What makes you so certain?"
    ],
    [
        "When a man can kills you or me, that's one thing."
    ],
    [
        "But when a copper gets killed, that's another story."
    ],
    [
        "Then all the other coppers realize maybe they're next."
    ],
    [
        "They won't rest till the murderer is caught."
    ],
    [
        "See?"
    ],
    [
        "What will you have, sir?"
    ],
    [
        "Same as usual."
    ],
    [
        "All right."
    ],
    [
        "Don't even know what this creature is."
    ],

        "Man, beast or devil."
    ],
    [
        "Well, I know I shan't run out alone again."
    ],

    ],
    [
        "Possibly."
    ],
    [
        "Probably."
    ],
    [
        "But there's something else about this."
    ],

        "Something obvious."
    ],
    [
        "Something right in front of us."
    ],
    [
        "You see, when there's something right before our eyes, we don't stop to ask how it got there."
    ],
    [
        "Like the ham in that sandwich."
    ],
    [
        "It's just there."
    ],
    [
        "We don't think of it at all."
    ],
    [
        "Much less stop to say, 'How did it get there?'"
    ],
    [
        "How did it get there, by the by?"
    ],
    [
        "Well, somebody put it there, I dare say."
    ],
    [
        "Yes."
    ],
    [
        "That's right."
    ],
    [
        "Somebody did."
    ],
    [
        "Sergeant?"
    ],

    ],
    [
        "Oh, it's you."
    ],
    [
        "Yes."
    ],
    [
        "Well, seen anything of the murderer?"
    ],
    [
        "No, nor has anybody else."
    ],
    [
        "I doubt if they ever will."
    ],
    [
        "Oh, I don't know."
    ],
    [
        "I've been thinking about it and an idea came to me just now."
    ],
    [
        "Oh, really?"
    ],
    [
        "Yes."
    ],
    [
        "Came to me all of a sudden, just a little while ago."
    ],
    [
        "Made me feel as though we've been blind."
    ],
    [
        "It's been staring us in the face."
    ],
    [
        "Oh, has it?"
    ],
    [
        "Well, if you're so sure, why not give us the benefit of this idea?"
    ],
    [
        "I'm going to."
    ],
    [
        "We were talking in the bar now about things that are staring us in the face."
    ],
    [
        "Things that we don't think about to question."
    ],
    [
        "Like the ham in a sandwich, you know."
    ],
    [
        "We never wonder how it got there."
    ],
    [
        "But somebody said, 'Well, if it's there,"
    ],
    [
        "'somebody must have put it there. '"
    ],
    [
        "And that was it."
    ],
    [
        "Now, if four people have been murdered, somebody must have been there to murder them, you see."
    ],
    [
        "Well, of course someone was there."
    ],
    [
        "We all know that."
    ],
    [
        "Question is, who?"
    ],
    [
        "Yes."
    ],
    [
        "The answer seems so simple now."
    ],
    [
        "But there's one thing I don't understand."
    ],
    [
        "One little thing I'd like to clear up."
    ],
    [
        "I mean, the motive."
    ],
    [
        "As man to man, tell me, Sergeant Ottermole,"
    ],
    [
        "just why did you kill those inoffensive people?"
    ],
    [
        "Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Newspaperman,"
    ],
    [
        "I don't know."
    ],
    [
        "In fact, I've been worried about it myself."
    ],
    [
        "But, I've got an idea, just like you."
    ],
    [
        "Everybody knows we can't control the workings of our minds, don't they?"
    ],
    [
        "Ideas come without our asking."
    ],
    [
        "But everybody's supposed to be able to control the workings of his body."
    ],
    [
        "Why?"
    ],
    [
        "Our arms, our legs, our heads, aren't completely ours."
    ],
    [
        "We don't make them."
    ],
    [
        "And couldn't ideas come into our limbs, just like ideas come into our minds?"
    ],
    [
        "Huh?"
    ],
    [
        "Couldn't ideas live in nerve and muscle as well as in the brain?"
    ],
    [
        "And couldn't it be that parts of our bodies aren't really us?"
    ],
    [
        "And ideas could come into those parts all of a sudden like ideas come into"
    ],
    [
        "my hands?"
    ],
    [
        "Are you all right?"
    ],
    [
        "Are you all right?"
    ],
    [
        "Yes."
    ],
    [
        "I never saw anything so quick or anyone so strong."
    ],
    [
        "I thought I was done for, for a moment."
    ],
    [
        "I know."
    ],
    [
        "We were following as close as we dared."
    ],
    [
        "It's a good thing we got the constable here in time."
    ],
    [
        "The sergeant."
    ],
    [
        "I can't believe it."
    ],
    [
        "His hands were like iron."
    ],
    [
        "Yes, his hands."
    ],
    [
        "Did you hear what he said about his hands?"
    ],
    [
        "He said ideas came into his hands."
    ],

        "He must have been insane."
    ],
    [
        "Yes"
    ],

        "I suppose so."
    ],
    [
        "Ow!"

    [
        "Stop it!"
    ],

    ],

    ],
    [
        "And you be ready, too."
    ],
    [
        "Good evening."
    ],
    [
        "I hope you'll excuse me for not being ready at show time but my watch is slow."
    ],
    [
        "As a matter of fact, it hasn't even gotten here yet."
    ],
    [
        "First, I would like to announce a change in our program."
    ],
    [
        "Shakespeare's Hamlet will not be presented tonight."

    ],

    ],
    [
        "'The Hands of Mr. Ottermole'"
    ],

        "No, thank you."

        "Well, here I am."
